The ###### carried heavy sacks up the hill.

She loves reading under the old oak tree.

A ###### brayed loudly near the barn.

Rain started falling just before sunset.

The farmer fed the ###### some fresh hay.

###### sang as the morning sun rose. 

He painted a picture of a ###### in the field.

The children played by the river all afternoon.

A ###### stood quietly in the shade.

Stars lit up the clear night sky.
