# Project 1
# We all have played snake, water gun game in our childhood. If you havenâ€™t, google the
# rules of this game and write a python program capable of playing this game with the
# user.

# The game is played between two players. Each player chooses one of three options: snake, water, or gun.
# The winner is determined by the following rules:
# - Snake beats water (snake drinks water)
# - Water beats gun (water washes gun)
# - Gun beats snake (gun shoots snake)
# - If both players choose the same option, it's a tie.
# - The game continues until one player wins a predetermined number of rounds (e.g., 3 rounds).
# - The program should keep track of the score and display it after each round.
